      <p className="mb-6 text-lg md:w-1/2">
        I have always enjoyed identifying problems in my life and finding
        solutions for them. When my parents started a group buying business,
        much of the work was done manually. After searching for pre-made
        solutions online and finding none that fit our business model, I decided
        to create my own. This marked the beginning of my journey as a
        self-taught developer.

        I began learning web development, and it immediately clicked with me.
        Hours would pass by as I immersed myself in learning and coding. In a
        short time, I built both a marketplace and an internal tool to manage
        it, providing a customized solution for our business needs.

        simultaneously. Additionally, I designed a custom split keyboard PCB to
        ensure the key layouts are ergonomically suited to my hands.
